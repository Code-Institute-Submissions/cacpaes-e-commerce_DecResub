<h2>UX/UI Design</h2>

<p>During the elaboration of the project, the aspects for the final result to respect a good UX (User experience) and UI (User interface) behavior were taken into consideration, thus delivering a quality project where the user can follow the steps of a purchase without difficulties or complications.</p>

<h3>Strategy</h3>

<h3>Site goals</h3>

<p>As mentioned, the project is an eCommerce project. I chose books as the main product to be sold in the online store. The business model is B2C where our target audience is direct consumers.

The idea of marketing and promotion would be the presence on social networks aiming at the themes of the books and their importance in our culture and education. With a well-designed SEO for the site that conveys trust and transparency to users, I believe it would be a project with the potential for success.</p>

*  The Second Hand Books e-commerce store aims to be responsive across devices to reach and be available to as many people as possible.
*  That the online store has a practical and simple checkout, requesting only the most important information to finish the order safely.
*  That the website provides feedback on important user actions, such as messages informing when logged in, logged out, when the order was completed, or at other relevant times.
*  The website should prioritize the display of the posts and present the content in a good way.
*  That users can view offers and discounted prices.
*  Be practical to register and access the account/profile for users who wish to do so.
*  So that users can easily add products to their bag and also modify it with convenience.


<h3>Agile</h3>

<p>For the development of this project, the Agile methodology was applied. As a support tool, I used the GitHub projects.</p>
